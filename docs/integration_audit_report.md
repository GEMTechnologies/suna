# Integration Audit Report

## Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `.env` samples omitted required Supabase secret and several provider credentials | Documented all mandatory keys in `backend/.env.example` and clarified frontend configuration expectations in `frontend/.env.example`. |
| LiteLLM service only routed OpenAI-compatible and Bedrock profiles | Added provider-aware router construction with dedicated entries for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and Bedrock credentials. |
| Router fallback logic hard-pinned to Bedrock MAP profiles, breaking when AWS keys absent | Added dynamic fallback generation so non-AWS providers remain functional locally and Bedrock paths are only used when credentials are configured. |
| Model registry exposed only Bedrock-backed Anthropics | Restored comprehensive model catalog covering OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, DeepSeek, direct Anthropic, and Bedrock offerings with accurate pricing/metadata, while making Bedrock optional. |
| Missing SDK dependencies for Gemini and Groq APIs | Declared provider clients in `backend/pyproject.toml` to ensure Docker images and sync installs include them. |
| No automated connectivity validation for Redis, Supabase, or Daytona | Introduced `core/services/integration_health.py` to probe infrastructure endpoints with friendly CLI output. |
| Frontend UI could not badge Groq or DeepSeek models | Added provider metadata and SVG assets so dashboards render consistent branding for all integrations. |
| Docker services exited permanently on crash | Added restart policies to Redis, backend, worker, and frontend containers for better local resilience. |

## Verification

Run the targeted checks after installing backend dependencies with `uv`:

- `uv run pytest tests/test_model_registry_integrations.py`
- `uv run pytest tests/test_litellm_router_config.py`
- `uv run python -m core.services.integration_health`

> **Note:** External API calls still require valid provider credentials; the tests rely on static configuration and do not hit live endpoints.
